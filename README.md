## Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - The language used for coding
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) - The software used for coding
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - The library used to generate data frames and filtering data
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - The library used for creating graphs

### Overview of Code

* Python code was generated to upload csv data into a Jupyter Notebook.  
* Pandas sliced and diced the data to section it out based on various fields (Year, Location, Median Home Prices).
* Matplotlib was used to plot the graphs and save copies of the respective images.  
* Scatter Plots and Line Graphs were created for visuals.  

### Research Questions

* When is the best month of the year to purchase a home?
* Has the housing market bounced back since the housing collapse in 2009?
* How does the US housing market compare to Minnesota?
