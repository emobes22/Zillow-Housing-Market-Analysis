# Project Title

Zillow Housing Market Analysis

## Introduction

The purpose of this project was to analyze housing market prices using Zillow data and identify trends.  

### Research Questions

When is the best month of the year to purchase a home?
Has the housing market bounced back since the housing collapse in 2009?
How does the US housing market compare to Minnesota?

### Tools Used

The following tools were used during the analysis.

```
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
Matplotlib
```


### Overview of Code

Python code was generated to upload csv data into a Jupyter Notebook.  

Pandas sliced and diced the data to section it out based on various fields (Year, Location, Median Home Prices).

Matplotlib was used to plot the graphs and save copies of the respective images.  

Scatter Plots were created as seen below.
